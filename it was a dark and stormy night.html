He was a good man with a good head on his shoulders—the type of fella that wouldn’t hurt a fly on a good day.

\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 7s t8n&gt;&gt;He really didn’t mean to, that’s for certain. It was all just—luck.

It was the kind of night where the worst was the best, where things would just go all twisted, all wrong, all tangled up in knots. And everything was already all knots but that night bad became worse.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 5s t8n&gt;&gt;He was sitting in his old recliner, beer in one hand and a remote flipping through a thousand channels in the other. There wasn’t really much else to do at night; she was long gone and he stopped caring about making messes ever since the one mess that changed everything. Didn’t need to bother looking after the boy either—brat avoided him like a leper nowadays. Was as close to him as an atheist was with God.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 10s t8n&gt;&gt;Another swig. The beer numbed the bitterness, a mother’s smooches on a bruise.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 11s t8n&gt;&gt;Kid moseyed in around the fourth bottle.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 12s t8n&gt;&gt;He doesn’t remember what the boy said, rarely does these days—things all sound the same when your brain’s all fogged up with funny juice.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 16s t8n&gt;&gt;But he reckons that it was the eyes that got him—doe eyes with whites too white and lashes too long and greens too green. Too much like the one he got ‘em from, too much like those blown-black ones from that time.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 19s t8n&gt;&gt;That time he found out that the one gal he’d ever love didn’t love him back.
&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 21s t8n&gt;&gt;He could’ve sworn he’d seen them, then and there, right in front of him, right where the kid was. Could’ve sworn he’d heard the sounds, the noises, the little, useless excuses spilling out from a swollen mouth. Could’ve sworn he got sent back to way back when, back to someplace at sometime where he wasn’t supposed to be. Felt some Old Testament wrath start creeping through his skin.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 26s t8n&gt;&gt;[[And from there everything went to hell. |page5]]&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="page5" tags="" position="1388,998" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;timed 1s t8n&gt;&gt;He remembers his old dog, Bailey.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 3s t8n&gt;&gt;She was a silly rascal—a yellow-furred mutt whose tail was always wagging and paws were always clambering up to the knees, begging for a treat. &lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 5s t8n&gt;&gt;He remembers his Bailey, in all her excitable, puppy-joy glory. Remembers when she moved to the farm one day. Remembers how much he missed her but knew it was for the best. Remembers that it was only about a good three years later that he found out there wasn’t any farm.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 10s t8n&gt;&gt;Ma ran over the poor thing and didn’t want him to know. Made up the whole fib and buried her secret in the backyard. &lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 13s t8n&gt;&gt;He looks at the halo of brown locks lying in red and thinks that this was probably how she felt back then.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 16s t8n&gt;&gt;Like mother, like son; he panics. Scurries over to the youngling, heart beating fast like the beer gushing out from the broken bottle. Boy ain’t breathing. He could barely feel the little thump-thump-thump that he should feel when he places two fingers at the scamp’s neck. &lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;

\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 22s t8n&gt;&gt;His throat’s scorching, burning bad like all hell. Hands in his hair, he curses again and again, scraping away at his scalp as if it’d help with anything.&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;
\&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;&lt;timed 26s t8n&gt;&gt;“Gotta calm—gotta calm down.”&lt;&lt;/timed&gt;&gt;

Makes him remember all those boring days at Sunday school, them rain-grey days where they’d sit in a circle and talk about this Jesus fella and how He died for their sins. How they broke bread and drank wine in His name.

It was that memory that gave him the idea—something he didn’t consider, ‘cause who in the hell would?

He looks down at the boy, hears Father Josiah’s voice reciting, “Take this and eat, for this is my body.”

He thinks about it for a bit, hates himself a bit for even thinking about it but the more he thinks, the more he realizes that this might just be his best option.

So far, so good—

“Abe? Is that you?”

It was his neighbour, Jolene. Nice dame; one of the little old ladies that cooked like Betty Crocker and smiled like Betty White.

“What are you doing out so late?”

He sees his neighbour Jolene out on her porch and freezes.

Waits for the old crone to go or somethin&#39; before he does anything else. 

Eventually, she gets sleepy, goes night-night for a bit.

He takes this time to scurry on over to his car. 

He lays down the dead boy in the trunk carefully, closes the car door without a peep.

Another deep breath.

Fingers shaking, [[he switches on the ignition. |DrivesAway]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Lies to Neighbour" tags="" position="1117,1827" size="100,100">“Heading out for some fresh air.”

“Oh that&#39;s a good idea. It&#39;s such a lovely night.”

“Yeah.”

He talks to her some more, trying to be all polite but all he wants is to choke the hag and be over with this already.

“What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got there, dear?”

His blood runs cold. “Nothing much. Just some canned food for the shelters.”

“Oh, such a kind soul.”

His smile goes tight.

When the small talk&#39;s over and done and he&#39;s finally in his car, he lets out a breath.

Doesn&#39;t even reply. 

//Can&#39;t// even reply.

“Sir, can you open your trunk?”
