The boy went down with just a swing.


Don’t get him wrong; he loved the kid, he did. He was a good man with a good head on his shoulders—the type of fella that wouldn’t hurt a fly on a good day. But those days just weren’t good days and that day happened to be his worst. 


He really didn’t mean to, that’s for certain. It was all just—luck. Just bad, bad luck.


***


It was a dark and stormy night: the kind of night that was too cold like bitter melon soup with the kind of rain that was too mean like the biggest bully in the playground. It was the kind of night where the worst was the best, where things would just go all twisted, all wrong, all tangled up in knots. And everything was already all knots but that night bad became worse.


He was sitting in his old recliner, beer in one hand and a remote flipping through a thousand channels in the other. There wasn’t really much else to do at night; she was long gone and he stopped caring about making messes ever since the one mess that changed everything. Didn’t need to bother looking after the boy either—brat avoided him like a leper nowadays. Was as close to him as an atheist was with God.


Another swig. The beer numbed the bitterness, a mother’s smooches on a bruise.


Kid moseyed in around the fourth bottle. 


He doesn’t remember what the boy said, rarely does these days—things all sound the same when your brain’s all fogged up with funny juice. 


But he reckons that it was the eyes that got him—doe eyes with whites too white and lashes too long and greens too green. Too much like the one he got ‘em from, too much like those blown-black ones from that time.


That time he found out that the one gal he’d ever love didn’t love him back.


He could’ve sworn he’d seen them, then and there, right in front of him, right where the kid was. Could’ve sworn he’d heard the sounds, the noises, the little, useless excuses spilling out from a swollen mouth. Could’ve sworn he got sent back to way back when, back to someplace at sometime where he wasn’t supposed to be. Felt some Old Testament wrath start creeping through his skin.


And from there everything went to hell.


***


He remembers his old dog, Bailey.


She was a silly rascal—a yellow-furred mutt whose tail was always wagging and paws were always clambering up to the knees, begging for a treat. 


He remembers his Bailey, in all her excitable, puppy-joy glory. Remembers when she moved to the farm one day. Remembers how much he missed her but knew it was for the best. Remembers that it was only about a good three years later that he found out there wasn’t any farm.


Ma ran over the poor thing and didn’t want him to know. Made up the whole fib and buried her secret in the backyard. 


He looks at the halo of brown locks lying in red and thinks that this was probably how she felt back then.


Like mother, like son; he panics. Scurries over to the youngling, heart beating fast like the beer gushing out from the broken bottle. Boy ain’t breathing. He could barely feel the little thump-thump-thump that he should feel when he places two fingers at the scamp’s neck. 


“F██.” 


His throat’s scorching, burning bad like all hell. Hands in his hair, he curses again and again, scraping away at his scalp as if it’d help with anything.


“Gotta calm—gotta calm down.”


Closes his eyes. Deep breaths.


In.


Out. 


In.


Out.


Okay.


First things first: 


1. Move the body. Hide the crime, do no time.
2. Head straight to the car. Things’re too much now. Might as well leave it.


A


Boy hasn’t eaten a good meal in ages; he’s all skin and bones. Makes it easier to carry him, though.


He walks into the kitchen.


Guy combs through the cupboards, eyes skimming over bare shelves, empty containers and rotting wood. He finds a garbage bag for the body but there ain’t nothing else other than an old, flickery flashlight, a tiny little crucifix and some rusty silverware. He goes and looks some more, finds some rope and a shovel in the shed out back.


He doesn’t want to attract too much attention and he ain’t got enough pockets to carry everything, so he decides to take 


1. The flashlight and the shovel.
2. The rope and some makeshift weights.


 


________________


Flashlight and shovel
He pockets the flashlight, tucks the shovel under his arm.


He heads back to where the boy was, takes the garbage bag from earlier and stuffs the kid in there like them mags he used to keep under his mattress.


Fella’s got a few options now, but he thinks it’s probably best if he 
1. Hides the body in the forest. Place’s dark, deep and far from lovely. Not many people go there.
2. Hides the body in the dump. They say once a man’s trash, another man’s treasure, but let’s face it—folks these days like shiny, new things, not shabby, run-down crap. Boy’ll probably be rot and mold before he’s found. 


Rope and “weights”
He pockets the rope and takes a couple of empty milk jugs, fills ‘em up with water before capping ‘em off. 


He heads back to where the boy was, takes the garbage bag from earlier and stuffs the kid in there like them mags he used to keep under his mattress.


Fella’s got a few options now, but he thinks it’s probably best if he 
1. Hides the body in the lake. The milk jugs’ll weigh it down, make sure the kid don’t float. He’ll sink so deep that no one’ll ever fish him out.
2. Hides the body in the dump. They say once a man’s trash, another man’s treasure, but let’s face it—folks these days like shiny, new things, not shabby, run-down crap. Boy’ll probably be rot and mold before he’s found.




Crucifix
It catches his eye for some reason, the little man on the cross.


Makes him remember all those boring days at Sunday school, them rain-grey days where they’d sit in a circle and talk about this Jesus fella and how He died for their sins. How they broke bread and drank wine in His name.


It was that memory that gave him the idea—something he didn’t consider, ‘cause who in the hell would?


He looks down at the boy, hears Father Josiah’s voice reciting, “Take this and eat, for this is my body.”


He thinks about it for a bit, hates himself a bit for even thinking about it but the more he thinks, the more he realizes that this might just be his best option.


The kitchen knife winks at him from where it’s sitting on the counter.


***


It smells good, he’ll say that.


Not too shabby.


He hates the spit pooling in his mouth at the scent, tries to cling onto the sick stinging heat rising in his throat. 


Like the kid, he hasn’t had a good meal in a long while. 


He takes a bite. Lets it sit in his mouth for a bit like he’s feasting on holy bread.


The meat tasted sweet.
















Secret


His sins stare back at him with milk eyes.










“It matters not for the tree has fallen.”
